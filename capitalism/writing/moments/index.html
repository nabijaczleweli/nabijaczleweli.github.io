"A Widow's Trace"<br />
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">— <em>Tien, tien.</em> Looks like we'<!--'-->ɹe woɹking rogetheɹ. —<br />
<em>Some</em>thing made Widowmaker say, as it always did, ruining her<br />
chances. From her standpoint, anyway.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Don't think I'm happy about that! — Tracer exclaimed<br />
back, the same <em>some</em>thing making her so. And ruining<br />
<em>her</em> chances, too. Or, from her standpoint, at least.<br /></div>
"Attack commences in 30 seconds." A cold<br />
female voice interrupted their bickering<br />
<div class="indented">— We both know that's not quite true, is it? — Mercy's whisper<br />
sent a wave of electricity through Tracer's body.<!--'--><br />
Tracer checked for Widow, but she was reassembling her<br />
beloved rifle on a table next to them, facing away in<br />
total concentration, so she nodded, very deeply, lost<br />
in her own world of fantasy.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">"Five" Tracer snapped back to reality.<br />
"Four" Widowmaker cycles the bolt on her rifle.<br />
"Three" Seven-Six checks his utility belt.<br />
"Two" McCree pulls out and cocks his Peacekeeper<br />
incredibly tense.<br />
"One" Zenyatta wakes from meditation.<br />
"Attack" Everyone dashes out. Except that Tracer<br />
trails behind Widow, who aims her Grapple. Tracer's<!--'--><br />
eyes start glowing; figuratively, of course.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Oi, before you get up there, grab me!<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>H</em>what?<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Come on, just do it! — Tracer first got hold of Widow's<!--'--><br />
waist, to which she reciprocated. — Right, now grapple us up<br />
there!<br /></div>
The sharp yank wasn't as sharp as she expected and rather<!--'--><br />
soon they were stood on a narrow passage made of sandstone.<br />
<div class="indented">— Y'ready? Hold me very tight now, this thing is...<!--'--><br />
But she didn't finish and was navigating the air,<!--'--><br />
which you hafta admit is hard, if you can only maneuver<br />
horizontally. A couple terrifying seconds later they<br />
landed way behind enemy lines, with a clear view on all of<br />
them.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Now's your opening, luv!<!--'--></div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">Widow hoisted the firearm to her shoulder, aimed in, and<br />
fired. Reaper's head seemed to have exploded. She leaned<!--'--><br />
leftward, sighted in and fired again. Reinhardt befell<br />
upon his knees; then collapsed fully as the second shot sounded.<br />
Tracer was humming some melody, leaned back against a wall.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Ssh! — Widow raised her free hand.<br />
Tracer froze mid-hum and mid-headsway as Widow's<!--'--><br />
head locked at an extraordinary angle,<br />
listening to the faintest of sounds.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Get ɹeady to get us out of 'eɹe. — She alerted<!--'--><br />
and grappled directly upwards.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">On the way down she sighted in and last time on Symmetra;<br />
she lost precision due to a very narrow<br />
angle of opening, though, so she just started crawling<br />
around with her knee in shatters. Widow landed next<br />
to Tracer perfectly quietly.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Ready, luv?<br />
Widow just nodded as she grasped for Tracer's torso. She didn't<br />
feel the yank of Tracer's Chronal Accelerator – she<!--'--><br />
passed out. Tracer stroked her hair and somehow navigated<br />
the air with much more ease than even when she was alone.<br />
She had to cease quite shortly, though, as Widowmaker woke just<br />
seconds after passing out.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">— Ah, magnifique. — She sighed, looking at the battlefield,<br />
or at Tracer (it was rather hard to tell, especially from Tracer's<!--'--><br />
perspective).<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Aye, that was a most impressive display.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>H</em>what? — Widow was still somewhat confounded,<br />
then noticed the ambiguity in her statement and<br />
suddenly became flustered. Tracer didn't notice, as<!--'--><br />
she was cherishing how Widow was confused enough<br />
not to let her go.<br /></div>
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
And so they lasted, seemingly endlessly, cherishing a moment<br />
tranquil as very few are for soldiers at war. Then it all<br />
came down crashing like a broken mirror as adrenaline<br />
made way for endorphins and endorphins – for exhaustion.<br />
As many of these moments, this one was saved by the party<br />
returning with figurative spoils.<br />
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">— Hey, aren't these our lost gals? — McCree,<!--'--><br />
suddenly alert, re-holstered<br />
his Peacekeeper.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— It would seem that they are. — Zenyatta send out<br />
his Orb t (a) treat their potential injuries and<br />
(b) to harvest data about the situation. — I suggest<br />
a delicate approach.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Well, they did a magnificent job out there, made our<br />
work exceedingly easy. — Growled Seven-Six. — <br />
We've gotta congratulate and/or thank them.<!--'--><br /></div>
<div class="indented">— No medical assistance necessary, I presume? —<br />
Inquired Mercy to Zenyatta.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Indeed.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">By this time they'd approached Tracer&amp;Widow to<!--'--><br />
a distance at which a converstaion could<br />
be held comfortably.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Nice work out there; innovative in the ery deed. Our<br />
job was just cleanup duty after that. — Seven-Six broke the silence<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Cheers, mate. — Tracer smiled and looked at Widow to see why<br />
she was being so uncharacteristically<br />
quiet and reacted not to the compliment, and quite a big one<br />
at that, coming from Seven-Six. — Oh, she's<!--'--><br />
asleep, the poor thing — She gently poked Widow<br />
and wispered in her ear. — Soldier here says you<br />
did a good job.<br /></div>
Widowmaker woke. — Ah, merci.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Yaes? — Mercy tilted her head away from her conversation<br />
with McCree. Then, realising her mistake,<br />
giggled softly.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Y'all fancy a drink? All this Peacekeeping's making me<br />
thirsty<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— I don't see why not. — Vocalised his approval<!--'--><br />
Seven-Six as everyone else nodded.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">As everyone was getting settled, Zen noted,<br />
that Lena wasn't, as was usual, avoiding<!--'--><br />
Amélie, and, indeed, didn't as much as flinch when she<!--'--><br />
took a seat next to her.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Four whiskeys, please. — Inquired McCree the barman.<br />
Upon receiving the order, and many orders thereafter,<br />
unsurprisingly, everyone was rather intoxicated, yet<br />
was holding strong (okay, barring Zenyatta, who vacated the<br />
scene after Angela stopped being coherent). Even Amélie<br />
and Lena, temporarily forgoing their differences, were leaning upon<br />
each other, chanting a French-Brit love song. After<br />
yet another round, Lena lost the delicate balance and fell onto<br />
Amélie's thighs, fast asleep. Amélie shuddered, she<!--'--><br />
yearned for this, ever since Gérard died.<br />
She sat Lena (mostly) upright, managed to<br />
stand up herself, waved at the remaining party, someway<br />
lifted Lena from under the table, where she managed to<br />
slide, and thanking some lord for leaving her with perfect<br />
motoric function despite her drunkedness, going up several<br />
flights of stairs and fishng out the key to her room from<br />
her vest. Having semi-sat-semi-laid Lena on her bed,<br />
she untied both sets of shoes and slid them off,<br />
wrangled the duvet from under Lena, laid next to her and then<br />
it atop them. For the first time in however many years<br />
she fell asleep quickly and without longing for Gérard;<br />
as if knowingly, Lena's<!--'--><br />
head found her back and remained there. And that was the last thing<br />
she remembered.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Sunlight hit the window blinds, dimly illuminating the small hotel<br />
room as it did. The brightness, however suppressed, had woken<br />
Lena, who lay against a back, eyes closed, reveling<br />
in the sensation she'd been longing for ever since Emily's<br />
passing. But, as such moments often are, this one needed to be interrupted,<br />
this time but the need to dull out Lena's growing hangover headache by consuming<!--'--><br />
a sizeable amount of water, a task of monumental<br />
difficulty, (a) because the headache got worse as she<br />
moved and moving itself was already heavily impaired and (b) she was<br />
extremely comfortable, and at the moment cared naught for<br />
whose back her forehead was against. Eventually,<br />
though, the moment had to be broken, for if she didn't<!--'--><br />
move at once she'd deface the shoulderblades in front of her,<!--'--><br />
herself and what she presumed to be the bed shie lie on with<br />
the contents of her stomach. Somehow she managed to roll<br />
off onto the floor and stumbled towards the nearest sink,<br />
located in the bathroom, where she drank vigorously and<br />
managed to keep her stomach in check, and began<br />
to crawl back to where she lie before and froze temporarily as<br />
her gaze fell upon Amélie. "So she's gone and bloody<!--"--><br />
done it." She thought. "Oh well." And<!--"--><br />
continuted along, as she did. Laying back down and<br />
re-emplacing her forehead at Amélie's back, but, alas (or<!--'--><br />
not?) the temperature difference was enough to wake her.<br />
Lena intook a breath sharplyand exhaled slowly,<br />
shutting her eyes, making the moment last as logg as possible,<br />
expecting it to be broken as soon as Amélie shifted over to face<br />
her, but, instead, she just grabbed her and<br />
hugged her closed to her chest.
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">Moments like this don't last; this<!--'--><br />
one did. It wasn't broken, it just transformed<!--'--><br />
when Lena felt Amélie's hot tears upon her face.<br /><!--'--></div>
<div class="indented">— What's wrong, luv?<br /><!--'--></div>
<div class="indented">— I don't know... Eveɹything's coming back to me... I 'aven't<br />
felt this way since Gérard died. May I? — She interrupted,<br />
pulling Lena in for a kiss. Lena reciprocated<br />
with the highest degree of passion. Suddenly, she<br />
couldn't wait any longer. She reached down to Amélie's waist and<br />
put her hand under her shirt against the cold blue<br />
back, sending shivers through both of them,<br />
using it to slide the shirt off while Amélie<br />
scrambled for the zipper on Lena's jacket, being<!--'--><br />
interrupted, however, by her shirt sliding past her eyes,<br />
then pleasantly surprised the jacket having<br />
slod off while her vision was obscured. As she<br />
reached for Lena's trouser button, she was stopped<!--'--><br />
by her surprisingly strong, yet gentle, hands. Their<br />
eyes met.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— One more thing, luv.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>Hmmmm</em>? — Amélie was having problems with phrasing<br />
anything coherent.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— I'm still pissed. — Lena's tone was hard to decypher<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— I know, I know, I know. — Her hands were set free and<br />
felt her tears being butterfly kissed away by Lena's<!--'--><br />
soft lips, somehow managing to undo the button she<br />
was struggling with &amp; sliding the trousers down, finding<br />
Lena's hands doing the same to hers. Soon they were<!--'--><br />
both relieved of their trousers, and adequately, Lena<br />
was the first to plunge her fingers inside Amélie, implanting her<br />
mouth on the Frenchie's, swallowing her moan as she reciprocated.<!--'--><br />
Both of them came fast and hard,<br />
starved almost beyond belief (or, well, beforehand),<br />
their moans melding into one as they did. No words were uttered<br />
no sounds were made, a moment eternally<br />
tranquil; moments like that aren't made to last,<!--'--><br />
yet this one, again, did, and drifted off as they fell asleep.<br />
in each other's arms.<!--'--></div>

<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">The sun set and they awoke again, conscious now of<br />
everthing they had together. Or, well, most of it, anyway.<br />
Some things needed to still be sorted out and made sure<br />
about.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— So...<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Yaes?<br />
<div class="indented">— Aren't you hungry, luv?<br /><!--'-->
<div class="indented">— For you... — Amélie smiled. — But otheɹwise, no.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Well, then, you obviously have something on your mind, so go first<br />
first.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>H</em>why now, afteɹ all this time? When did you stop to despise<br />
me? — Amélie flushed, or, well, as best as she could.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— That purple's really cute, you should do that more<!--'--><br />
often. Or I guess I could. — Lena's mind suggested the view of<!--'--><br />
Amélie's cheeks as she came. — But, anyway, there<!--'--><br />
was something in you passing out in my arms, your body<br />
against mine, in the withering Egyptian heat that made me finally<br />
crack. As for my despising you... Shortly after I got out of the<br />
black void my filfe became after Emily's death. I realised<!--'--><br />
you're just acting on orders and, well, you did get brainwashed<!--'--><br />
by Talon... — Lena sighed. — You fancy a cuppa?<br />
<div class="indented">— Suɹe. You 'ave questions, too?<!--'--><br />
<div class="indented">— Ya, how'd you know to take me up here yesterday?<!--'--><br />
When'd you know you dig me?<!--'--><br />
<div class="indented">— Pfh, did you ɹeally think I passed out foɹ so long? — Now it was<br />
Lena's turn to flush, which had nothing to do with the steam<!--'--><br />
from the Earl Grey she was making, Amélie grinned. — Not 'aɹd<!--'--><br />
to pɹetend to be <em>h</em>when youɹ pulse is almost as good as dead.<br />
As foɹ shoveling, I always 'ad a wild cɹush on you, especially<!--'--><br />
afteɹ I out of <em>my</em> black void afteɹ I killed Gérard.<br />
But must of all, it was you, afteɹ I passed out,<br />
you made me feel – foɹ the fiɹst time in a long time<br />
caɹed foɹ, loved, even, I guess. — Lena leaned in with<br />
the tea. — Ah, merci. — She took a sip. — Merdé, chaud!<br />
<div class="indented">— Oi? It's obviously hot, (a) because it's how you do it<br />
properly. — Lena looked temporarily stuck with love<br />
to her homeland and the Queen, but composed herself<br />
quickly – and (b) <em>you're</em> hot, so it seemed appropriate.<!--'--><br />
<div class="indented">— Oh, you. — Amélie took another sip. — Dɹinkable.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Heyyy, you like it. Pass the test,<br />
you did. — Lena giggled softly. — Also, I'd hoped that if I gave<!--'--><br />
you very hot tea you'll blush again, the purple's much<br />
beter a colour than your usual blue.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">Seeing that Amélie's finished her tea, Lena leaned in again<!--'--><br />
to kiss her, snatching the saucer&amp;cup and setting<br />
them down in relative safety. Into a kiss they pertained.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Moments like that aren't made to last, but sometimes,<!--'--><br />
just timetimes, they do. And they change the world.
