&emsp;In our profession, old age is quite a rare quality to be found.
The young divide into two groups: the bold and the play-it-safe little bitches.
The latter, rather obviously, live long. Or, rather, as long as they don'<!--'-->t encounter an enemy who is quite the match for them.
Then, obviously, they die, as both their intellectual and fighting prowess cease to make a lasting impression on such enemy.
The real trick is to withdraw at the right time.
Those who do, become rulers and/or occupy mid-to-high-end governmental positions and live off pension doing naught,
  yet being borderline revered by the public.
You can'<!--'-->t blame them, though; that'<!--'-->s how they'<!--'-->re trained and they know little beyond that.
And that is why you don'<!--'-->t see much, or, for that matter, any at all, of old of the latter in our trade.

&emsp;Once in a while, though, a man smart (or stupid) enough to reject such safe, yet boring tactics is born.
They mostly die rather early on, which is quite to be expected, yet, once in a while a man agile both physically and mentally rises.
Their rise, as most are, is attributed to sheer luck
