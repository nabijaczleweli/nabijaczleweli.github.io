&emsp;Degenerate call 2016, the biggest annual source of income for many governmental workers, including me.
Hell, it'<!--'-->s not even that the job'<!--'-->s hard or requires special training, which it doesn'<!--'-->t,
  it'<!--'-->s just that there'<!--'-->s a tremendous amount of degenerates to be handled in a three-day period.
Thankfully enough, my departament handles the stage 2 of degenerate handling process, so we already get them presorted as the music-listening kind.
</p>
<p>
&emsp;The process is really not that bad, for the most of them.
Just the usual questions about sexual activity, influence of certain artists over the individual degenerate'<!--'-->s life, et cetera; routine stuff, really.
Then come the head-splintering verification tests. That sounds scary but it'<!--'-->s basically a polygraph that lets us gleam a little bit more information.
If you answered truthfully you'<!--'-->ll have no problems and we ask you to come again next year.
</p>
<p>
&emsp;If, however, you lied or you otherwise confessed to being heavily influenced by <em><strong>REDACTED</strong></em>,
  not that there'<!--'-->s anything inherently wrong with that (some would even call you an innocent victim),
  there'<!--'-->s a good chance your family will not ever see you again.<br />
...And recognise you.

&emsp;Our national theatre hosts an annual life-sized puppet show.
The strings that hold up the puppets are made of shoelaces, and there'<!--'-->s probably some historical reason for that, not that I'<!--'-->d care.
Regardless of how obvious that makes the puppetry,
  it'<!--'-->s highly praised for "incredible life-likeness" and "movement fluent as if the puppets had a life of their own", but I already said too much...
<em>*Vocal scratch.*</em>
</p>
<br />
<p>
&emsp;<em>There'<!--'-->s no time for that, it matters naught, now the only relief is in dance.
Dance and fly, high as a kite. The highest praise – the sighs of amazement from the crowd.</em>
