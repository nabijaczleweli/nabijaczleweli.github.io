<p class="writing indented">
"Speak to me, father", I called loudly, "for I am in need of advice."<br />
<em>"Oh what is it with this bloody cat, it's getting louder by the day!" *Sigh.* "Might as well try calm it down with this, eh?"</em><br />
My calls were answered: "Right, let's get over this quick, I don't've much time for this advice shit."
  Must'<!--'-->ve caught him mid-something, a pity. I liked to chat with him when he had time.<br />
<em>"Shouldn't he be chasing the laser instead of meowing at it?"<br />
    "No idea. Do continue meowing, though, seems to calm him down faster."</em><br />
"Father, I turn to you for advice once again, for I am facing a conundrum of the century"<br />
<em>*Sigh.*</em> "And that'd be?"<br />
"I was wondering, whether, should I find myself in a situation..." My father'<!--'-->s image flickered. "Are you listening?"<br />
<em>"Don't unclick the pointer! Is your hand shaking?"<br />
    "I just get excited by science in any and all forms, and you've got a notepad, so we're no longer just fucking around with our cat."</em><br />
"I am listening."<br />
"Should I find myself in a situation that presents itself as providing me two food sources, one of which is not meant for me,<!--"-->
  is it acceptable to consume food from both sources?"<!--"--><br />
My father'<!--'-->s image seems to have steadied slightly as his voice was no longer bored.
"Indeed, that is the question for a lifetime. I shall discuss it with the elders. I will get back to you tomorrow."<br />
<em>"My hand's shaking too much, take the pointer and I'll meow and take notes instead."</em><br />
"Farewell, father." I bid and backed out of the room.<br />
<em>"So that's just it, eh? It just meows for the last time and leaves?"<br />
    "As is clearly evident. So what should we do with the notes?"<br />
    "No earthly idea, let's stash them somewhere and append to them next time."</em>
