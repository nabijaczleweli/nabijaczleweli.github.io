<!-- ePub title: "Utopian Assassin" -->



<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5l4iqi/wp_in_a_futuristic_utopia_the_government_mails">"Utopian Assassin"</a><br />

<p class="writing indented">
Life'<!--'-->s easy. For ordinary people. You do something good, you get money in up to 7 days processing time plus postal service delays.
You make someone happy, you get money in up to 7 days processing time plus postal service delays. You get the idea.
Here'<!--'-->s another simple-to-get idea: the better the thing you do, or the happier you make someone the more money you get
  (in up to 7 days processing time plus postal service delays).
I met one of the guys that make the formulas for payout calculations, they'<!--'-->re <em>crazy</em>, lemme tell ya.
The whole money-for-good-stuff business reflected positively on human happiness and economical growth in the last couple of years,
 all more the reason to rejoice, right?
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Locally, yes. Globally, not quite.
You see, the whole utopian government business works on a medium scale, but doesn'<!--'-->t quite scale up to the level of the whole continent.
Also, the system doesn'<!--'-->t actually <em>punish</em> bad behaviour, so, naturally, people have taken to exploiting it.
How to exploit the system? Keep slaves and sometimes don'<!--'-->t beat them! Magnificent. Fucking. Job. Extraordinary, utopian government.
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
That'<!--'-->s where I come in. I'<!--'-->m an official governmental assassin.
That means that not only do I get to murder people and get paid for it, which is pretty sick,
  but I also work for the government so I need not worry about the bodies.
The guy that was keeping slaves? Fucking slaughtered, thanks to our utopian government law enforcement'<!--'-->s demographics department.
Maybe you'<!--'-->re not as bad, utopian government.
The downside is I legally can'<!--'-->t claim happiness money for killing people that were causing dishappiness,
  much like a detective can'<!--'-->t claim money for bringing a sought fugutive to justice.
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
So, one day I'<!--'-->m woken up by a courier ringing at my door.<br />
"Comiiiiiiiiiing!" I yelled to get him off the damned bell.<br />
"Sir, there's a delivery for you. You need to sign <em>here</em> and <em>here</em>." He gestured at dotted areas as I started to read the delivery bill.<br />
"This can't be right..." I muttered to myself. "A'ight, thanks, mate. Dump it there."
 I gestured over in the general direction of the old German bunker I had cleaned up in my back yard.
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Yawning and examining the delivery bill closer, I stumbled back in. Three hundred thousand dollars. In fifty-cent coins. From the government.
Labeled "happiness money". Couldn'<!--'-->t be right.
I failed to recall any recent non-government-contracted murders of this magnitude, so I called my handler (of course I have a handler).<br />
"Yo, I just got a delivery of three hundred thousand dollars in halves." I started, still perplexed.<br />
"So what's the problem?"<br />
"It's labeled 'happiness money' and I haven't done any off-the-books contracts recently."<br />
"You know well and good that we have no knowledge as to the cause. And I checked that transfer personally, it's correct."<br />
"Righty ho'..." I tried to end the conversation, but I got interrupted.<br />
"You should turn on the news."<br />
And so I did. "<em>Recent reports suggest that the leader of the communist Cuba was assassinated yesterday and the people have started a coup.</em>"<br />
"I guess they'll be able to overthrow the government, but how does that factor into..."<br />
"Think! Who killed the guy?"<br />
"I did, and you know that. But I can't receive happiness money for that because you, as in the government, contracted it."<br />
<em>*Slapping sound.*</em> "Oh god, I just remembered."<br />
"Did you just facepalm <em>in real life</em>?"<br />
"Yes. But I remembered why you got that money."<br />
"And?"<br />
"The legislation says you can't collect happiness money resulting from your governmental contracts <em>in the country</em>."<br />
"Well, that's an oversight, right?"<br />
"Yep, I'll take it up with the higher-ups. But for now, enjoy your new-found wealth."<br />
"A'ight, see ya, mate."
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Life'<!--'-->s easy. Now for Cubans and me, too.
