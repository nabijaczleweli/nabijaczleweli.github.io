<!-- ePub title: "Cucumber Dog" -->

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/5kt8x0/wp_you_meet_a_dog_who_stands_upright_with_his">"Cucumber Dog"</a><br />
<p class="writing indented">
Jakub was returning from the pub when he stumbled upon a stray.
Normally he'<!--'-->d just kick it and stumble forward but this thing had a toxic-green knapsack and was somehow resilient to his multiple kicks.
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
"Kurde, what was I drinking?", he muttered to himself, "I'm supposed to be seeing white mice and/or elephants, not poodles with backpacks."<br />
"I am on a journey looking for Ass, Potatoes, &amp; Cucumbers. Can you assist me?", responded the dog.
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
There were, however, two problems. First, the dog'<!--'-->s voice was rather high-pitched and quiet.
That was quickly fixed by Jakub stumbling and falling upon a bump in the road and the dog utilising that opportunity to repeat its line.
The second, however, was much greater – Jakub understood not a <em>word</em> of English.
He recognised that the dog spoke the language, though, as that sounded rather similarly to what his grandson tried to teach him over the summer holidays.
He struggled for a Very Long While as he searched for a single word of English his grandson managed to teach him.
It was proving elusive, until...
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
"Okej", that was the only word he could remeber in this state.<br />
"Magnificent. I'll just follow you, then", the dog responded, not that Jakub understood. Or, for that matter, listened at all.<br />
"Okej", Jakub confirmed again.<br />
The dog was still babbling but Jakub cut it out and forced himself to attempt to walk in a roughly straight line. The dog, thankfully, followed.
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
By the time he arrived at his house Jakub was sober enough to regain the nimbleness of his fingers.
He pulled out his trusty brake cord with a loop on the end, and, like many before, made short work of the dog.<br />
Assessing his haul, he nodded affirmatively: a couple days'<!--'--> worth of fresh meat and an unused toxic-green knapsack,
  a perfect gift for his grandson when he comes over for holidays.
