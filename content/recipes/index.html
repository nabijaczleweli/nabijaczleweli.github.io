  Again, for me the recipe suffers from her flour having, oddly, since she lives in a hotter wetter climate, much more flour per flour
  (I had three hands and three gloops of flour more to get the same consistency on both as she did);
  conversely, her sugar is absolutely sodden.

  Unclear what the hell happened, but she appears to be doing these on a well-maintained casting; it turned out all my normal-sized plastic pans are apparently ass.
  Similarly, it appeared impossible to <em>not</em> get something much thicker than what she got,
  with reduced volumes just yielding smaller pancakes of a constant depth.
  Except for like three, none of them behaved at all.
  The surface didn'<!--'-->t really change colour to yellower in the same way that hers did;
  it did get a bubble in the middle, but it was only sufficiently stable to flip when either
  (a) never because it burned on the ass pan, or (b) it was already quite fried, and hers were still white at this time.

  <li>for each guy: spin him flat, ballify him, hide under plastic – or some magical plastic that doesn'<!--'-->t stick to it, because the one I had did</li>
  <li>for each guy: flatten directly, roll out radially (somewhere in the vicinity of upward of <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2mm</span>) leaving a thicker area for the ass in the middle, re-hide –
      I misunderstood the video, and did this individually before packing each bun;
      worked fine tho;
      it really does help to have something that'<!--'-->s mostly round</li>
  <li>for each guy: get him on your off-hand, center over the kuckles, <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">3-4</span> spoons of gloop and squish it, close it, spin around to enforce the ass,
      deposit on paper in basket –
      this may've been because I've never shut up a bun before so I didn'<!--'-->t really know how I usually liked,
      or that I need mechanical assitance to bend my hand that way, or w/e, but I got in <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2-3</span> spoons at most; operator error</li>
  <li>they sleep there covered for <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">10min</span> –
      they only grow a bit sideways while sleeping but much more when steaming; I knew this and still put them too close together</li>

      idk how I'<!--'-->d get pokchois, so I used what came out to <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">473g</span> of kapusta pekińska ("napa cabbage" apparently), and I had lower cook volume so <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2min</span>,
      and that behaved like hers did</li>
  <li>"a few washed shiitakes", thick cuboidsed, same cooking –
      looks like <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">7</span> big ones; all the shrooms I had on hand was <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">30g</span> of dried shiitakes, and those, re-wetted, worked fine in here,
      compensated with more leeks and that worked</li>
  <li>big tall pan, considerable volume of oil, a "dozen peppercorns", <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">1</span> star anise pod, fried until the pepper changes colour, plants removed –
      my pepper does not look like hers, unclear to me what I'<!--'-->d call what she put in there</li>
  <li>chopped ginger – similar quantity to <a href="#leek-cake">last time</a> was a tad small –
      and all but half a handful of two medium-but-all-white-bit-leeks(?), halved length-wise and shredded, until they change colour</li>
  <li>minced hog (but not too fine), fried until mostly-cooked –
      <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">800g</span> was about right proportionally,
      but seemed leaner or drier than what she had, so compensated with remainder of the hog fat from <a href="#leek-cake">last time</a>,
      and the commercial stuff I got was in extrusions and pre-cutting them to like <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">1.5cm</span> worked to get a similar granulation to what she has</li>
  <li>pepper, "bean paste" (miso?), soy sus, oyster sus, salt, "chicken essence" (bit of a boullion cube?), fry to fully cook and disperse the colour –
      one and a most of a <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">15g</span> miso packet was too little for this much schmeat; fish sus worked well I think; half a "strong" boullion cube</li>
  <li>the shiitakes, keep frying for <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">1min</span>, extract, cool</li>
  <li>the blanched pokchois, rest of the leek, mix</li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  Quite easy (sans the wrapping, but the first pieróg you wrapped also looked like ass and now you can do them without looking, so);
  the lard in the dough is magic.

  <li><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">200g</span> of <a href="//cohost.org/nabijaczleweli/post/1404618-this-user-just-got">corn</a>,
      flock with <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">200g</span> of boiling water,
      let cool until not hot to second knuckle – with the eggs you want to get a good yeast temp</li>
  <li><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">3g</span> of yeast, spoon of sugar, two eggs – mine are <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">~70g</span></li>
  <li><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">200g</span> of flour – maybe my eggs are huge, maybe idk, but starting with <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">250g</span> and likely adding slightly more to get to a reasonable "dough" consistency
      — instead of a paste, which doesn'<!--'-->t rise; the spec is to <em>maybe add water</em> which is insane to me —
      worked for me to avoid the <a href="https://cohost.org/nabijaczleweli/post/1433335-little-secondary-ris"><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2023-05-02</span></a> incident again</li>
  <li>flock, accrue, knead in bowl for <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">5min</span>, he sleeps in the covered bowl for <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">40min</span></li>
  <li>knead a bit on floured counter to de-gas, roll into cylinder, cut into <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">~12</span> guys –
      there's a critical mass above which they won't re-rise(?), and <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">9</span> left them too big
      (again, <a href="https://cohost.org/nabijaczleweli/post/1433335-little-secondary-ris"><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2023-05-02</span></a>),
      <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">13</span> and <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">12</span> worked very well, and she does <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">12</span></li>
  <li>for each guy:
   <ol>
    <li>spin him flat – thus averaging the crust that'<!--'-->s inevitably developed</li>
    <li>cylindrise, flatten, roll out long –
        you want a high aspect ratio and relatively thin;
        if he sticks to the counter then unstick him, flour the counter, and zoom him around so he'<!--'-->s free for the next step</li>
    <li>start a cut through the middle <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">~.5-1cm</span> from one edge, and through the other</li>
    <li>"braid him like a braid", i.e. keep passing one over the other,
                                       keep the top-facing faces facing the top and the counter-facing faces facing the counter</li>
    <li>at the end, weld the halves together again – the best-kept secret here is that no matter how badly you do any of this it'<!--'-->ll turn out great</li>
    <li>flip (dry side up wet side down now),
        roll from the welded bit to the uncut bit,
        stick the tongue that'<!--'-->s left to the side, may need water assist</li>
    <li>ass-down spin him around a bit to ensure flat perpendicular ass</li>
    <li>hide under a cover</li>
   </ol>
     – this took me like <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">50</span> minutes the first time, and like <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">40</span> the third
   </li>
  <li>oil a pan, lay them there, they sleep covered for <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">15min</span></li>
  <li>crank to medium for three minutes –
      maybe her leccy pan is more powerful than my stove, I need like <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">1min</span> on 9 then <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">4min</span> on 6,
      you'<!--'-->re shooting for a well-developed brown crust on the ass</li>
  <li>pour water <span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">⅓</span><sup>rd</sup> way up – the guys? the pan? idk. – kill the heat, they steam until the water gets sucked off (<span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">~10min</span>)</li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  These came out just about perfect <a href="https://cohost.org/nabijaczleweli/post/1413956-okay-these-are-pog-c"><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2023-04-29</span></a>,
  but the water level is finnicky, and pouring in more and turning the heat back on turns out badly for me
  (stuck to bottom; <a href="https://cohost.org/nabijaczleweli/post/1433335-little-secondary-ris"><span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">2023-05-02</span></a>,

  Maybe this is easier if you have a plastic pan the right size, but my biggest (<span class="roboto-unscale math-font-normal">Φ245</span>) is stainless (but the right size).
  Operator error.
