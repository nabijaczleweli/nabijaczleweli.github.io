<p class="writing indented">
Not ever would she expect this.<br />
She was supposed to be dead weeks ago,<br />
A dead woman walking.<br />
Not the whole of her was dead, though.<br />
She was carrying life.<br />
Her last words: "run, while you still can".<br />
And there she stood, reborn; and hungry for blood.<br />
The procedure worked.<br />
Not ever would she expect this.
