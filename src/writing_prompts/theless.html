Now, she didn'<!--'-->t want <em>any</em> of this. All that Queen&amp;Country service was putting a tax on her.
No, she wasn'<!--'-->t exactly unhappy with it, as her salary was surprisingly high for a governmental worker,
  but she had a family and spending upwards of ten hours at her office wasn'<!--'-->t exactly something her wife and proverbial kids appreciated.

<span class="badindented">— Mostly, yes. I mean, your coital expertise is extraordinary, too, but it was just a bonus, really.<br /></span>
<span class="badindented">— So, before you kill me, just one more thing, luv. My so-called last words, if you will?<br /></span>
<span class="badindented">— Sure, I guess it <em>is</em> your priviledge as an executee.<br /></span>
<span class="badindented">— "Painted Black"<br /></span>
