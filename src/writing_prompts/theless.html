&emsp;Now, she didn'<!--'-->t want <em>any</em> of this. All that Queen&amp;Country service was putting a tax on her.

&emsp;— Mostly, yes. I mean, your coital expertise is extraordinary, too, but it was just a bonus, really.<br />
&emsp;— So, before you kill me, just one more thing, luv. My so-called last words, if you will?<br />
&emsp;— Sure, I guess it <em>is</em> your priviledge as an executee.<br />
&emsp;— "Painted Black" – Snipers fire.
