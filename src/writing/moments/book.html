"A Widow's Trace"<br />

<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">— <em>Tien, tien.</em> Looks like we'<!--'-->ɹe woɹking rogetheɹ. —<!--SOFT_BR-->
<em>Some</em>thing made Widowmaker say, as it always did, ruining her<!--SOFT_BR-->
chances. From her standpoint, anyway.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Don't think I'm happy about that! — Tracer exclaimed<!--SOFT_BR-->
back, the same <em>some</em>thing making her so. And ruining<!--SOFT_BR-->
<em>her</em> chances, too. Or, from her standpoint, at least.<br /></div>
"Attack commences in 30 seconds." A cold<!--SOFT_BR-->
female voice interrupted their bickering<br />
<div class="indented">— We both know that's not quite true, is it? — Mercy's whisper<!--SOFT_BR-->
sent a wave of electricity through Tracer's body.<!--'--><br />
Tracer checked for Widow, but she was reassembling her<!--SOFT_BR-->
beloved rifle on a table next to them, facing away in<!--SOFT_BR-->
total concentration, so she nodded, very deeply, lost<!--SOFT_BR-->
in her own world of fantasy.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">"Five" Tracer snapped back to reality.<br />
"Four" Widowmaker cycles the bolt on her rifle.<br />
"Three" Seven-Six checks his utility belt.<br />
"Two" McCree pulls out and cocks his Peacekeeper<!--SOFT_BR-->
incredibly tense.<br />
"One" Zenyatta wakes from meditation.<br />
"Attack" Everyone dashes out. Except that Tracer<!--SOFT_BR-->
trails behind Widow, who aims her Grapple. Tracer's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
eyes start glowing; figuratively, of course.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Oi, before you get up there, grab me!<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>H</em>what?<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Come on, just do it! — Tracer first got hold of Widow's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
waist, to which she reciprocated. — Right, now grapple us up<!--SOFT_BR-->
there!<br /></div>
The sharp yank wasn't as sharp as she expected and rather<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
soon they were stood on a narrow passage made of sandstone.<br />
<div class="indented">— Y'ready? Hold me very tight now, this thing is...<!--'--><br />
But she didn't finish and was navigating the air,<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
which you hafta admit is hard, if you can only maneuver<!--SOFT_BR-->
horizontally. A couple terrifying seconds later they<!--SOFT_BR-->
landed way behind enemy lines, with a clear view on all of<!--SOFT_BR-->
them.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Now's your opening, luv!<!--'--></div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">Widow hoisted the firearm to her shoulder, aimed in, and<!--SOFT_BR-->
fired. Reaper's head seemed to have exploded. She leaned<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
leftward, sighted in and fired again. Reinhardt befell<!--SOFT_BR-->
upon his knees; then collapsed fully as the second shot sounded.<!--SOFT_BR-->
Tracer was humming some melody, leaned back against a wall.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Ssh! — Widow raised her free hand.<br />
Tracer froze mid-hum and mid-headsway as Widow's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
head locked at an extraordinary angle,<!--SOFT_BR-->
listening to the faintest of sounds.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Get ɹeady to get us out of 'eɹe. — She alerted<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
and grappled directly upwards.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">On the way down she sighted in and last time on Symmetra;<!--SOFT_BR-->
she lost precision due to a very narrow<!--SOFT_BR-->
angle of opening, though, so she just started crawling<!--SOFT_BR-->
around with her knee in shatters. Widow landed next<!--SOFT_BR-->
to Tracer perfectly quietly.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Ready, luv?<br />
Widow just nodded as she grasped for Tracer's torso. She didn't<!--SOFT_BR-->
feel the yank of Tracer's Chronal Accelerator – she<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
passed out. Tracer stroked her hair and somehow navigated<!--SOFT_BR-->
the air with much more ease than even when she was alone.<!--SOFT_BR-->
She had to cease quite shortly, though, as Widowmaker woke just<!--SOFT_BR-->
seconds after passing out.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">— Ah, magnifique. — She sighed, looking at the battlefield,<!--SOFT_BR-->
or at Tracer (it was rather hard to tell, especially from Tracer's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
perspective).<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Aye, that was a most impressive display.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>H</em>what? — Widow was still somewhat confounded,<!--SOFT_BR-->
then noticed the ambiguity in her statement and<!--SOFT_BR-->
suddenly became flustered. Tracer didn't notice, as<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
she was cherishing how Widow was confused enough<!--SOFT_BR-->
not to let her go.<br /></div>
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
And so they lasted, seemingly endlessly, cherishing a moment<!--SOFT_BR-->
tranquil as very few are for soldiers at war. Then it all<!--SOFT_BR-->
came down crashing like a broken mirror as adrenaline<!--SOFT_BR-->
made way for endorphins and endorphins – for exhaustion.<!--SOFT_BR-->
As many of these moments, this one was saved by the party<!--SOFT_BR-->
returning with figurative spoils.<!--SOFT_BR-->
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">— Hey, aren't these our lost gals? — McCree,<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
suddenly alert, re-holstered<!--SOFT_BR-->
his Peacekeeper.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— It would seem that they are. — Zenyatta send out<!--SOFT_BR-->
his Orb t (a) treat their potential injuries and<!--SOFT_BR-->
(b) to harvest data about the situation. — I suggest<!--SOFT_BR-->
a delicate approach.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Well, they did a magnificent job out there, made our<!--SOFT_BR-->
work exceedingly easy. — Growled Seven-Six. — <!--SOFT_BR-->
We've gotta congratulate and/or thank them.<!--'--><br /></div>
<div class="indented">— No medical assistance necessary, I presume? —<!--SOFT_BR-->
Inquired Mercy to Zenyatta.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Indeed.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">By this time they'd approached Tracer&amp;Widow to<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
a distance at which a converstaion could<!--SOFT_BR-->
be held comfortably.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Nice work out there; innovative in the ery deed. Our<!--SOFT_BR-->
job was just cleanup duty after that. — Seven-Six broke the silence<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Cheers, mate. — Tracer smiled and looked at Widow to see why<!--SOFT_BR-->
she was being so uncharacteristically<!--SOFT_BR-->
quiet and reacted not to the compliment, and quite a big one<!--SOFT_BR-->
at that, coming from Seven-Six. — Oh, she's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
asleep, the poor thing — She gently poked Widow<!--SOFT_BR-->
and wispered in her ear. — Soldier here says you<!--SOFT_BR-->
did a good job.<br /></div>
Widowmaker woke. — Ah, merci.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Yaes? — Mercy tilted her head away from her conversation<!--SOFT_BR-->
with McCree. Then, realising her mistake,<!--SOFT_BR-->
giggled softly.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Y'all fancy a drink? All this Peacekeeping's making me<!--SOFT_BR-->
thirsty<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— I don't see why not. — Vocalised his approval<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
Seven-Six as everyone else nodded.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">As everyone was getting settled, Zen noted,<!--SOFT_BR-->
that Lena wasn't, as was usual, avoiding<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
Amélie, and, indeed, didn't as much as flinch when she<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
took a seat next to her.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Four whiskeys, please. — Inquired McCree the barman.<br />
Upon receiving the order, and many orders thereafter,<!--SOFT_BR-->
unsurprisingly, everyone was rather intoxicated, yet<!--SOFT_BR-->
was holding strong (okay, barring Zenyatta, who vacated the<!--SOFT_BR-->
scene after Angela stopped being coherent). Even Amélie<!--SOFT_BR-->
and Lena, temporarily forgoing their differences, were leaning upon<!--SOFT_BR-->
each other, chanting a French-Brit love song. After<!--SOFT_BR-->
yet another round, Lena lost the delicate balance and fell onto<!--SOFT_BR-->
Amélie's thighs, fast asleep. Amélie shuddered, she<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
yearned for this, ever since Gérard died.<!--SOFT_BR-->
She sat Lena (mostly) upright, managed to<!--SOFT_BR-->
stand up herself, waved at the remaining party, someway<!--SOFT_BR-->
lifted Lena from under the table, where she managed to<!--SOFT_BR-->
slide, and thanking some lord for leaving her with perfect<!--SOFT_BR-->
motoric function despite her drunkedness, going up several<!--SOFT_BR-->
flights of stairs and fishng out the key to her room from<!--SOFT_BR-->
her vest. Having semi-sat-semi-laid Lena on her bed,<!--SOFT_BR-->
she untied both sets of shoes and slid them off,<!--SOFT_BR-->
wrangled the duvet from under Lena, laid next to her and then<!--SOFT_BR-->
it atop them. For the first time in however many years<!--SOFT_BR-->
she fell asleep quickly and without longing for Gérard;<!--SOFT_BR-->
as if knowingly, Lena's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
head found her back and remained there. And that was the last thing<!--SOFT_BR-->
she remembered.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Sunlight hit the window blinds, dimly illuminating the small hotel<!--SOFT_BR-->
room as it did. The brightness, however suppressed, had woken<!--SOFT_BR-->
Lena, who lay against a back, eyes closed, reveling<!--SOFT_BR-->
in the sensation she'd been longing for ever since Emily's<!--SOFT_BR-->
passing. But, as such moments often are, this one needed to be interrupted,<!--SOFT_BR-->
this time but the need to dull out Lena's growing hangover headache by consuming<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
a sizeable amount of water, a task of monumental<!--SOFT_BR-->
difficulty, (a) because the headache got worse as she<!--SOFT_BR-->
moved and moving itself was already heavily impaired and (b) she was<!--SOFT_BR-->
extremely comfortable, and at the moment cared naught for<!--SOFT_BR-->
whose back her forehead was against. Eventually,<!--SOFT_BR-->
though, the moment had to be broken, for if she didn't<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
move at once she'd deface the shoulderblades in front of her,<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
herself and what she presumed to be the bed shie lie on with<!--SOFT_BR-->
the contents of her stomach. Somehow she managed to roll<!--SOFT_BR-->
off onto the floor and stumbled towards the nearest sink,<!--SOFT_BR-->
located in the bathroom, where she drank vigorously and<!--SOFT_BR-->
managed to keep her stomach in check, and began<!--SOFT_BR-->
to crawl back to where she lie before and froze temporarily as<!--SOFT_BR-->
her gaze fell upon Amélie. "So she's gone and bloody<!--"--><!--SOFT_BR-->
done it." She thought. "Oh well." And<!--"--><!--SOFT_BR-->
continuted along, as she did. Laying back down and<!--SOFT_BR-->
re-emplacing her forehead at Amélie's back, but, alas (or<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
not?) the temperature difference was enough to wake her.<!--SOFT_BR-->
Lena intook a breath sharplyand exhaled slowly,<!--SOFT_BR-->
shutting her eyes, making the moment last as logg as possible,<!--SOFT_BR-->
expecting it to be broken as soon as Amélie shifted over to face<!--SOFT_BR-->
her, but, instead, she just grabbed her and<!--SOFT_BR-->
hugged her closed to her chest.
</p>
<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">Moments like this don't last; this<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
one did. It wasn't broken, it just transformed<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
when Lena felt Amélie's hot tears upon her face.<br /><!--'--></div>
<div class="indented">— What's wrong, luv?<br /><!--'--></div>
<div class="indented">— I don't know... Eveɹything's coming back to me... I 'aven't<!--SOFT_BR-->
felt this way since Gérard died. May I? — She interrupted,<!--SOFT_BR-->
pulling Lena in for a kiss. Lena reciprocated<!--SOFT_BR-->
with the highest degree of passion. Suddenly, she<!--SOFT_BR-->
couldn't wait any longer. She reached down to Amélie's waist and<!--SOFT_BR-->
put her hand under her shirt against the cold blue<!--SOFT_BR-->
back, sending shivers through both of them,<!--SOFT_BR-->
using it to slide the shirt off while Amélie<!--SOFT_BR-->
scrambled for the zipper on Lena's jacket, being<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
interrupted, however, by her shirt sliding past her eyes,<!--SOFT_BR-->
then pleasantly surprised the jacket having<!--SOFT_BR-->
slod off while her vision was obscured. As she<!--SOFT_BR-->
reached for Lena's trouser button, she was stopped<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
by her surprisingly strong, yet gentle, hands. Their<!--SOFT_BR-->
eyes met.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— One more thing, luv.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>Hmmmm</em>? — Amélie was having problems with phrasing<!--SOFT_BR-->
anything coherent.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— I'm still pissed. — Lena's tone was hard to decypher<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— I know, I know, I know. — Her hands were set free and<!--SOFT_BR-->
felt her tears being butterfly kissed away by Lena's<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
soft lips, somehow managing to undo the button she<!--SOFT_BR-->
was struggling with &amp; sliding the trousers down, finding<!--SOFT_BR-->
Lena's hands doing the same to hers. Soon they were<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
both relieved of their trousers, and adequately, Lena<!--SOFT_BR-->
was the first to plunge her fingers inside Amélie, implanting her<!--SOFT_BR-->
mouth on the Frenchie's, swallowing her moan as she reciprocated.<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
Both of them came fast and hard,<!--SOFT_BR-->
starved almost beyond belief (or, well, beforehand),<!--SOFT_BR-->
their moans melding into one as they did. No words were uttered<!--SOFT_BR-->
no sounds were made, a moment eternally<!--SOFT_BR-->
tranquil; moments like that aren't made to last,<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
yet this one, again, did, and drifted off as they fell asleep.<!--SOFT_BR-->
in each other's arms.<!--'--></div>

<p class="writing">
<div class="indented">The sun set and they awoke again, conscious now of<!--SOFT_BR-->
everthing they had together. Or, well, most of it, anyway.<!--SOFT_BR-->
Some things needed to still be sorted out and made sure<!--SOFT_BR-->
about.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— So...<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Yaes?<br />
<div class="indented">— Aren't you hungry, luv?<br /><!--'-->
<div class="indented">— For you... — Amélie smiled. — But otheɹwise, no.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Well, then, you obviously have something on your mind, so go first<!--SOFT_BR-->
first.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— <em>H</em>why now, afteɹ all this time? When did you stop to despise<!--SOFT_BR-->
me? — Amélie flushed, or, well, as best as she could.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— That purple's really cute, you should do that more<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
often. Or I guess I could. — Lena's mind suggested the view of<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
Amélie's cheeks as she came. — But, anyway, there<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
was something in you passing out in my arms, your body<!--SOFT_BR-->
against mine, in the withering Egyptian heat that made me finally<!--SOFT_BR-->
crack. As for my despising you... Shortly after I got out of the<!--SOFT_BR-->
black void my filfe became after Emily's death. I realised<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
you're just acting on orders and, well, you did get brainwashed<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
by Talon... — Lena sighed. — You fancy a cuppa?<br />
<div class="indented">— Suɹe. You 'ave questions, too?<!--'--><br />
<div class="indented">— Ya, how'd you know to take me up here yesterday?<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
When'd you know you dig me?<!--'--><br />
<div class="indented">— Pfh, did you ɹeally think I passed out foɹ so long? — Now it was<!--SOFT_BR-->
Lena's turn to flush, which had nothing to do with the steam<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
from the Earl Grey she was making, Amélie grinned. — Not 'aɹd<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
to pɹetend to be <em>h</em>when youɹ pulse is almost as good as dead.<!--SOFT_BR-->
As foɹ shoveling, I always 'ad a wild cɹush on you, especially<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
afteɹ I out of <em>my</em> black void afteɹ I killed Gérard.<!--SOFT_BR-->
But must of all, it was you, afteɹ I passed out,<!--SOFT_BR-->
you made me feel – foɹ the fiɹst time in a long time<!--SOFT_BR-->
caɹed foɹ, loved, even, I guess. — Lena leaned in with<!--SOFT_BR-->
the tea. — Ah, merci. — She took a sip. — Merdé, chaud!<br />
<div class="indented">— Oi? It's obviously hot, (a) because it's how you do it<!--SOFT_BR-->
properly. — Lena looked temporarily stuck with love<!--SOFT_BR-->
to her homeland and the Queen, but composed herself<!--SOFT_BR-->
quickly – and (b) <em>you're</em> hot, so it seemed appropriate.<!--'--><br />
<div class="indented">— Oh, you. — Amélie took another sip. — Dɹinkable.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">— Heyyy, you like it. Pass the test,<!--SOFT_BR-->
you did. — Lena giggled softly. — Also, I'd hoped that if I gave<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
you very hot tea you'll blush again, the purple's much<!--SOFT_BR-->
beter a colour than your usual blue.<br /></div>
<div class="indented">Seeing that Amélie's finished her tea, Lena leaned in again<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
to kiss her, snatching the saucer&amp;cup and setting<!--SOFT_BR-->
them down in relative safety. Into a kiss they pertained.</div>
</p>
<p class="writing indented">
Moments like that aren't made to last, but sometimes,<!--'--><!--SOFT_BR-->
just timetimes, they do. And they change the world.
