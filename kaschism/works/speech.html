<h3 class="new-page" id="protocol">Protocol</h3>
<p><em>*clapping* *whistling*</em></p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;<strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong>: Thank you for such a warm welcome.
Now, this is my first inaugural speech, so bear with me a moment, if you will.
Firstly, thank you all for coming! We have over five hundred and sixty people here today, thank you ever so much.
Let us maybe start with last years' results, which, and I'm very proud to say this, are at an all-time high!
</p>
<p><em>*loud cheers*</em></p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;<strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong>: We have managed to fabricate and grow seven point fifty one per cent of last years' overall production,
which is an astonishing figure in and of itself,
but! there is another shadow that looms over both our organisation and each and every single one of us individually.
The monopolist-exporters' tentacles grow ever stronger in their embezzlement of our government,
right now a bill is being considered to lower the taxation on huge farms even more and increase it on small-to-medium farms to an even more unviable degree.
</p>
<p><em>*gasping*</em></p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;<strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong>: At such desparate times we, and every single unassociated farmer, need to stand together!
Provide a product healthier and more local than ever before! We must <em>not</em> let them change the consumers' dietary habits!
Our people's diet relies on groats and meat, <em>not</em> on rice and tofu!
</p>
<p><em>*<strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong> pretends to spit on floor*</em></p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;<strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong>: Now this is not just empty talk, here are the figures:
<em>*line graphs appear behind <strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong>'s back*</em>.
As you can see, ladies and gentlemen, the average consumer's diet, naturally consisting of meat and groats,
is being slowly economically manipulated to change to a diet foreign in origin and hostile towards its users.
This is done simply by reducing the prices of rice, tofu, and other easteurasian plants, while drastically increasing the one of groats and meat.
We need to put an end to this process, raise our production to bring our product at a competitive price to the British consumer!
We are the <em>last</em> line of defence from <strong><em>the destruction of our culture, and our people</em></strong>!
</p>
<p><em>*audience rises for a standing ovation*</em></p>
<p class="writing">
&emsp;<strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong>: <em>*wipes tear off cheek*</em> Thank you all! Now let's get on with the other speeches, shall we?
</p>
<p><em>*audience continues clapping and whistling as <strong>Phoebe Huckabee</strong> goes offstage*</em></p>
