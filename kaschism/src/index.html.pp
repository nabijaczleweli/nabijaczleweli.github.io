<p id="definition-short">
	<strong>Kaschism</strong> is an econo-social movement concerning the overuse of rice and other groat-like plants intead of groats themselves.
</p>

<p id="origin">
	The concept of Kaschism itself sprung to life as we were ordered to create an artistic manifesto.
	Now, since we all admire the "Communist Manifesto"'s effect on millions of people and one of us was off his tits,<!--'-->
	we came up with the name and the general idea shortly followed.
